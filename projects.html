        		<h1>Data Body - A Collaborative Interactive Piece</h1>
				<p>Digital Data is everywhere. It surrounds everything that we know. Although this is a reality that I grew up with, I’ve realized that we have little to no understanding about the digital data that has fused into our daily life and it’s huge impact that it has on us. I’ve been fascinated about the accumulation of data into our society and how something invisible can greatly influence our way of life without our consent. Do we have a right to our personal data? Does it in fact belong to us? And if so, would that make companies that use our data without our consent thieves? These themes directly inspired my initial idea to create an installation that presents a visualisation of something that is not normally visible and allows people to consider the scale and presence of data in everyday life.</p>
                <p>I worked with three other students on this project. Going into the brainstorming stage, we really only knew about the space we would install in - the back wall of UBCO’s Fina Gallery. We knew we would have a projector, and that we wanted to make it interactive, and of course we knew we wanted to focus on the theme of big data. That left us with a world of possibilities. It was, in fact, extremely challenging to get the ball rolling on concrete ideas. We had several brainstorming meetings staring at blank paper trying to form our ideas into something tangible. I think our biggest problem was that we were forcing the theme to be too obvious to people - there was a story we wanted to tell, but we didn’t give our viewers the opportunity to put the pieces together themselves. Once we realized this, we took a step back and began imagining a more abstract installation that takes the viewer and inserts them into the piece through their imagination. It was clear that a lot of research needed to be done in order to develop strong concrete ideas. </p>
                <p>When doing my initial research I came across a Japanese Artist named <b>Ryoji Ikeda</b>. Ikeda uses computer algorithms to compose musical works and then uses computer generated images and videos to go along with the musical works. He normally installs in large galleries with projection mapping on a large wall. The way Ikeda uses computational software as a center of his pieces really inspired me to create visuals that look like they came from a computer. One piece that particularly inspired me was datamatics. This piece is especially unique because it uses raw data to produce the art itself. It gives the theme of time and space within a small area and the viewer finds themselves lost within the sea of overcrowding data. 
                </p>
                <p>Not only did this piece spark my interest of raw data visualizations, but it opened my eyes to unique ways to display a projection within a certain space to transform the space and transport the viewer to another world. It is truly an Immersive Installation. This is something that I desperately wanted to incorporate into my own piece - a way to transport the reader from the gallery they were standing in to another place. This Ikeda piece had enormous influence on our piece and helped steer me in a direction that I didn’t know was possible.

				The inspiration that datamatics had on me definitely comes through in our final piece. Our main projection has the same stark black and white visuals that display numbers scrolling across the wall. We also incorporated similar data visuals through interactive elements. Overall, Ikeda played a huge role in the development and styling of our final piece.

				For the second part of my research, I wanted to focus on installations with an interactive and story element. I was introduced to a piece (or a group of pieces) called Mecaniques Discursives created by artists <b>Fred Penelle & Yannick Jacquet</b>. These artists have created a visual machine that combines old practices of wood cutting with new digital technology and projection mapping. They have done several variations of the pieces and have even done some installations on huge scales such as on the exterior of buildings. But perhaps the most immersive is the installation in a gallery. The vast installation spans multiple walls and displays a mix of strange but intriguing visuals of animals and nature combined with mechanical tools and futuristic looking objects. These images are brought to life through smart projection mapping. The viewer naturally follows the moving images around the room like a machine. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I loved this piece so much because of how the artists incorporated items that people can recognize, not just abstract data visualizations. And especially that these visuals in fact still held the same theme of Big Data. It opened my eyes to the possibility of using a combination of abstract visuals and recognizable objects. This piece also presented the unique work of projection mapping. It inspired me to design my piece with the idea of projection mapping in mind. My favorite thing about this piece that differs from the Ikeda piece is that there is a recognizable element and use of storytelling, which really solidified our art direction.

                <p>
					The influence this piece had on our planning shines through in our final piece. The center of the wall was displayed with the silhouette of a man in which the user interacts with. The silhouette is a recognizable figure that incorporates the theme of human beings' role with growing technology and data. We also used projection mapping similarly to Mecaniques Discursives by mapping different visuals that are only displayed when people touch certain parts of the silhouette cut out. Without influence from this piece, our final project would have likely missed out on displaying the information in a story-like way, which adds to the immersive element we were trying to achieve. 
				</p>

					Interactivity soon became the backbone to our piece. We wanted the viewer to be directly involved with the piece so we began researching ways to do this. I ended up jumping the gun and bought some Bare Conductive conductive Ink (the world’s first non-toxic conductive ink) with no knowledge of how or where to use it. I liked the idea of using conductive ink as it worked as a metaphor for a human completing a circuit. When someone touches the ink, they become part of the electrical circuit, similar to the way people’s data become integrated to the whole system.
