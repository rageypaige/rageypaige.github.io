        		<h1>Data Body - A Collaborative Interactive Piece</h1>
				<p>Digital Data is everywhere. It surrounds everything that we know. Although this is a reality that I grew up with, I’ve realized that we have little to no understanding about the digital data that has fused into our daily life and it’s huge impact that it has on us. I’ve been fascinated about the accumulation of data into our society and how something invisible can greatly influence our way of life without our consent. Do we have a right to our personal data? Does it in fact belong to us? And if so, would that make companies that use our data without our consent thieves? These themes directly inspired my initial idea to create an installation that presents a visualisation of something that is not normally visible and allows people to consider the scale and presence of data in everyday life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I worked with three other students on this project. Going into the brainstorming stage, we really only knew about the space we would install in - the back wall of UBCO’s Fina Gallery. We knew we would have a projector, and that we wanted to make it interactive, and of course we knew we wanted to focus on the theme of big data. That left us with a world of possibilities. It was, in fact, extremely challenging to get the ball rolling on concrete ideas. We had several brainstorming meetings staring at blank paper trying to form our ideas into something tangible. I think our biggest problem was that we were forcing the theme to be too obvious to people - there was a story we wanted to tell, but we didn’t give our viewers the opportunity to put the pieces together themselves. Once we realized this, we took a step back and began imagining a more abstract installation that takes the viewer and inserts them into the piece through their imagination. It was clear that a lot of research needed to be done in order to develop strong concrete ideas. </p>
                <br>
                <p>When doing my initial research I came across a Japanese Artist named Ryoji Ikeda. Ikeda uses computer algorithms to compose musical works and then uses computer generated images and videos to go along with the musical works. He normally installs in large galleries with projection mapping on a large wall. The way Ikeda uses computational software as a center of his pieces really inspired me to create visuals that look like they came from a computer. One piece that particularly inspired me was datamatics. This piece is especially unique because it uses raw data to produce the art itself. It gives the theme of time and space within a small area and the viewer finds themselves lost within the sea of overcrowding data. 
                </p>
                <br> 
                <p>Not only did this piece spark my interest of raw data visualizations, but it opened my eyes to unique ways to display a projection within a certain space to transform the space and transport the viewer to another world. It is truly an Immersive Installation. This is something that I desperately wanted to incorporate into my own piece - a way to transport the reader from the gallery they were standing in to another place. This Ikeda piece had enormous influence on our piece and helped steer me in a direction that I didn’t know was possible.
