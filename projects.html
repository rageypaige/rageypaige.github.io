				<h1>Data Body - A Collaborative Interactive Piece</h1>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NT22gXz1sCw"></iframe>
				<p>Digital Data is everywhere. It surrounds everything that we know. Although this is a reality that I grew up with, I’ve realized that we have little to no understanding about the digital data that has fused into our daily life and it’s huge impact that it has on us. I’ve been fascinated about the accumulation of data into our society and how something invisible can greatly influence our way of life without our consent. Do we have a right to our personal data? Does it in fact belong to us? And if so, would that make companies that use our data without our consent thieves? These themes directly inspired my initial idea to create an installation that presents a visualisation of something that is not normally visible and allows people to consider the scale and presence of data in everyday life.</p>
				<p>I worked with three other students on this project. Going into the brainstorming stage, we really only knew about the space we would install in - the back wall of UBCO’s Fina Gallery. We knew we would have a projector, and that we wanted to make it interactive, and of course we knew we wanted to focus on the theme of big data. That left us with a world of possibilities. It was, in fact, extremely challenging to get the ball rolling on concrete ideas. We had several brainstorming meetings staring at blank paper trying to form our ideas into something tangible. I think our biggest problem was that we were forcing the theme to be too obvious to people - there was a story we wanted to tell, but we didn’t give our viewers the opportunity to put the pieces together themselves. Once we realized this, we took a step back and began imagining a more abstract installation that takes the viewer and inserts them into the piece through their imagination. It was clear that a lot of research needed to be done in order to develop strong concrete ideas. </p>

				<h4>Artistic Inspiration</h4>
                <p>When doing my initial research I came across a Japanese Artist named <b>Ryoji Ikeda</b>. Ikeda uses computer algorithms to compose musical works and then uses computer generated images and videos to go along with the musical works. He normally installs in large galleries with projection mapping on a large wall. The way Ikeda uses computational software as a center of his pieces really inspired me to create visuals that look like they came from a computer. One piece that particularly inspired me was datamatics. This piece is especially unique because it uses raw data to produce the art itself. It gives the theme of time and space within a small area and the viewer finds themselves lost within the sea of overcrowding data. 
                </p>
                <p>Not only did this piece spark my interest of raw data visualizations, but it opened my eyes to unique ways to display a projection within a certain space to transform the space and transport the viewer to another world. It is truly an Immersive Installation. This is something that I desperately wanted to incorporate into my own piece - a way to transport the reader from the gallery they were standing in to another place. This Ikeda piece had enormous influence on our piece and helped steer me in a direction that I didn’t know was possible.

				<p>
				The inspiration that datamatics had on me definitely comes through in our final piece. Our main projection has the same stark black and white visuals that display numbers scrolling across the wall. We also incorporated similar data visuals through interactive elements. Overall, Ikeda played a huge role in the development and styling of our final piece.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the second part of my research, I wanted to focus on installations with an interactive and story element. I was introduced to a piece (or a group of pieces) called Mecaniques Discursives created by artists <b>Fred Penelle & Yannick Jacquet</b>. These artists have created a visual machine that combines old practices of wood cutting with new digital technology and projection mapping. They have done several variations of the pieces and have even done some installations on huge scales such as on the exterior of buildings. But perhaps the most immersive is the installation in a gallery. The vast installation spans multiple walls and displays a mix of strange but intriguing visuals of animals and nature combined with mechanical tools and futuristic looking objects. These images are brought to life through smart projection mapping. The viewer naturally follows the moving images around the room like a machine. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I loved this piece so much because of how the artists incorporated items that people can recognize, not just abstract data visualizations. And especially that these visuals in fact still held the same theme of Big Data. It opened my eyes to the possibility of using a combination of abstract visuals and recognizable objects. This piece also presented the unique work of projection mapping. It inspired me to design my piece with the idea of projection mapping in mind. My favorite thing about this piece that differs from the Ikeda piece is that there is a recognizable element and use of storytelling, which really solidified our art direction.

                <p>
					The influence this piece had on our planning shines through in our final piece. The center of the wall was displayed with the silhouette of a man in which the user interacts with. The silhouette is a recognizable figure that incorporates the theme of human beings' role with growing technology and data. We also used projection mapping similarly to Mecaniques Discursives by mapping different visuals that are only displayed when people touch certain parts of the silhouette cut out. Without influence from this piece, our final project would have likely missed out on displaying the information in a story-like way, which adds to the immersive element we were trying to achieve. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The creative research process was somewhat new to me going into this project. I had never been taught to explore other pieces of work and take inspiration to apply to my own work. The exploration of other artists was encouraged in this class and I am very grateful for that. Going through this process has helped me realize the importance of research. I believe that our piece would not have had the impact and complexity it did without the extensive research and inspiration we gained from the artists I have mentioned above.

				<h4>Project Creation</h4>
				<p>
					After doing the creative research our group soon decided that we wanted the piece to be centered around the observer, that they would be in control and part of the piece. Thus, interactivity became the backbone of our work. We wanted the viewer to be directly involved with the piece so we began researching ways to do this. I ended up purchasing some Bare Conductive conductive Ink (the world’s first non-toxic conductive ink) with no knowledge of how or where to use it. I liked the idea of using conductive ink as it worked as a metaphor for a human completing a circuit. When someone touches the ink, they become part of the electrical circuit, similar to the way people’s data become integrated to the whole system. In hindsight, we probably should have done a bit more research on the ink itself because the complexity of it became a problem. However, it did force us to teach ourselves more about arduino. And we did indeed learn a ton. 	
				</p>
				<p>
					Our group now had a ton of artistic inspiration, and a solid idea of what the physical requirements of the piece would look like. At this point, we decided we needed to split up the work based on each of our strengths. I took on the role of programming the piece using the popular software Max MSP to program projection mapping and Arduino to connect with the conductive ink. The other members of the group were responsible for designing the artwork, animations and overall look and feel of the piece. Splitting up the work in this way ended up working really well for us, however, it still took some time to get a working first prototype. Finally we decided on the idea to print out a large life size silhouette of a human. The human would have a heart design in which people could touch with the ink. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The significance of the human was the connection between data and humans. Having a human figure worked really well to integrate our theme of data with human life. We also wanted to have a heart, which symbolizes human life to be the piece that is connected by the ink. For me, the connection of a human heart to a piece of technology that produces thematic data animation was a really interesting way to introduce and play with the idea that data is taking over our lives and society. We knew, though, that the animations we created would be the key factor to ensuring that our piece drove home our key message. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The animations we produced for this piece were also extremely important. I produced the background animation which is simple but effective in demonstrating the data theme. The scrolling black and white numbers fall around the black figure and are meant to signify the information that is always around us that we cannot see, that these invisible numbers that describe us are a part of our society so much that they are recognizable, but we don’t choose to see the harm that they do. In contrast to this animation which is always playing in the background, we needed more animations to play when the viewer touched the points of the conductive ink.  For these animations, we decided to make a more clear approach. One member drew different technologies that exist in our everyday lives: tablet, phone, computer and laptop. These technologies are not usually seen as damaging, but as helpful tools that make our lives easier. We wanted to make the connection between a human heart and an iPhone, or computer. What is the connection? Do they rely on each other? Does one hold more power than the other? If so, which one?
				</p>
				<p>
				The final push of the piece came a couple days before installation. We decided that a touchable heart wasn’t enough - we wanted another area that could be touched and play more animations. The brain made sense for another part of the human body that is directly impacted by the influx of data. Adding the brain brought the piece together in a way we could not have imagined. It really created the full circle of a human brain with an artificial computer brain and the differences between them. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The installation went smooth and the piece came together beautifully in the gallery. We faced many challenged with this project, especially in the initial planning and brainstorming phase. The thing that really helped with deciding on key ideas was researching artists and famous installations. The hardware challenges we faced helped me learn about problem solving and debugging, and helped me become a better programmer. Overall, The Data Body is a reminder and perhaps an eye opener to how data surrounds us in ways we didn’t think was possible and it becoming integrated into our very beings whether we like it or not.
