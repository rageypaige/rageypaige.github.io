                            <p>ShopHopper is a mobile app that helps shoppers find outfits that match their style and size, all from local small businesses. When I started, ShopHopper was preparing for the launch of their app. I have worked closely with the CEO and developers to lead the Product Design for the app and help the company reach its goals.</p>

                            <p>ShopHopper officially launched their beta app in 2022. I was responsible for designing the mobile app experience from user flows to high-fidelity designs.</p>
                            <p>During this time, we had limited time and development resources so I focused on defining and building the most important features. The CEO and I conducted two rounds of user research to determine these features.</p>
                            <p>The following are the designs for the core features that were present for the app launch.</p>

                                <h3>Fashion Curation</h3>
                                <p>ShopHopper&amp;s fashion curation feature is the at the centre of our value proposition. Users tell us their favourite styles and clothing sizes and we find the best local pieces for them, prioritizing on-sale items. The goal is to create a relaxed shopping experience for people who want to support local business.</p>
                                <p>This feature combines complex back-end algorithms with an easy-to-understand interface to produce a digital app that saves people time, introduces them to new and unique fashion, all while supporting local.</p>

                            <p>While curation offers a low-effort shopping experience, we also want to allow users to explore local shops to find other items they might like. This is achieved by an intuitive searching and filtering experience.</p>
                            <p>Users can search for items they&amp;re interesting in and then refine those searches by inputting preferences for price, store, style, and more. After a few rounds of usability testing, the finalized UI can be seen here.</p>

                            <p>One month after the launch, the ShopHopper app had be downloaded around 500 times.</p>

                            <p>I conducted usability testing and user research sessions with around 30 users. During those sessions, my goal was to observe users using the app and discover any roadblocks or areas of improvement.</p>
                            <p>As the design lead, I was in charge of maintenance, optimizations, and new feature development of these web applications.</p>
                            <p>There was a common issue that appeared in almost all of the sessions which was the browsing experience. The browsing system in the existing app wasn't cutting it for users, so I began my design process to solve this problem.</p>
