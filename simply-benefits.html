                            <p>I started full-time as a UX Design Specialist at Simply Benefits in April 2021 after completing a one-year internship. I was the sole designer on the team and in charge of the design of all products from start to finish. The skills I've learned in this role are invaluable; I've become confident in my ability to lead projects, make important product decisions, and deliver polished UI designs.</p>

                        <div class="section-description">
                            <p>One of the larger projects I worked on at Simply Benefits was a complete overhaul of the Mobile App. I was the lead designer and in charge of research, ideation, and UX/UI.</p>
                            <p>The app is an extremely important part of the member experience. Users can submit claims, view usage, look up their coverage, and more.</p>
                            <p>It had been a year or two since the app had any updates or improvements.</p>
                            <div class="sub-title">
                                <h3>Goals</h3>
                                <p>1: Decrease the time it takes to submit a claim.</p>
                                <p>2: Help members better understand their coverage.</p>
                                <p>3: Clearly communicate members usage and remaining amounts.</p>
                                <p>4: Improve and modernize the outdated UI.</p>

                            <p>Starting with the Dashboard/Homepage, I wanted users to be immediately presented with information that they would otherwise go looking for.</p>
                            <p>Users can see their Latest Claims and Recent Usage, as well as quickly submit a claim by tapping the plus icon.</p>
                            <p>I also designed usage bars for the Claims and Spending Account Pages to show users how much they've spent and how much they have left.</p>

                        <div class="section-description">
                            <p>After the designs were launched we saw a large increase in app downloads. Members who had never used the app before were encouraged to download it, and existing app users were excited to update.</p>
                            <p>Our customer success team also received a lot of great feedback about the new designs.</p>
                            <p>I loved this project. Leading a redesign of an app so early in my career was intimidating but rewarding. I couldn't be happier with the results.</p>

                            <p>In addition to the mobile app, Simply Benefits has three desktop web applications for three different customers and users; Advisors, Employers, and Employees.</p>
                            <p>As the design lead, I was in charge of maintenance, optimizations, and new feature development of these web applications.</p>
                            <p>The following designs are from the larger projects I worked on.</p>

                                <p>Optional benefits are 100% digital flexible add-on benefits for employees. Employees can purchase benefits individually which both improves their insurance experience and provides a new income stream for the company.</p>
                                <p>I designed this feature from start to finish, starting with research and wireframes. After polishing the UI, I tested the prototype on different users to improve the flow.</p>
                                <p>This feature was launched in 2024, and though I'm no longer with the company, I heard about the great receiption of the feature through my old collegues.</p>

                                <p>One of the most impressive Simply Benefits features for advisors is the digital quoting tool that allows them to quote groups 100% digitally. The industry standard turnaround time for quotes is about 4-6 weeks, and this feature takes that time down to about 5 days.</p>
                                <p>The old version of this feature was outdated, confusing, and clunky. It didn't have a clear step-by-step process, and as a result, it wasn't being used.</p>
                                <p>I helped reorganize the back-end structure and flow and was in charge of designing the UI to go along with it. The updated UI is clear, concise, and clean. Since it has been launched, we've seen an increase in digital quote creation.</p>
