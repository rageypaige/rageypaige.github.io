        <p>The motivations for this project came from my interest in data. I have been very interested in data, and the many ways you can visualize it since starting my studies at UBC. COVID-19 has presented us with a lot of new data, and I wanted to make it visual for people in an interesting way that they could easily understand, and might ultimately be meaningful for them. 
        </p>
        <p>In this <a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/platimer/sketches/EL4vdYi0t">visualization</a>, each line and circle represent one day since the initial lockdowns in Canada in March. As you move the slider, you see the days being drawn. The lines represent COVID-19 cases and the circles above them represent COVID-19 related deaths. Larger lines and circles correspond to a higher number. The squiggly vertex seen around the visualization also represents deaths.</p>
        <p>COVID-19 numbers are thrown around a lot without a lot of real meaning. At the time of writing this, <b>12,030</b> Canadians have died due to COVID-19. I feel that we need to step back and look at each of these 12,130 people and see them as individual lives. We need to think about their families and everything they have lost, and feel compassion.</p>
		<p>The dataset I used for this project was from the <a href ="https://covid19.who.int/region/amro/country/ca">World Health Organization</a>. I converted the dates into a count of days since March 16th. I used the data for daily cases and daily deaths as well as cumulative deaths.</p>
