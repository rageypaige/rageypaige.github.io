                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>I started full-time as a UX Design Specialisty at Simply Benefits in May 2021. I was the sole designer on the team and in charge of the design of all products from start to finish. The skills I've learned in this role are invaluable; I've become confident in my ability to lead projects, make important product decisions, and deliver polished UI designs.

            <h1>Mobile App Designs</h1>
            <p>One of the larger projects I worked on at Simply Benefits was a complete overhall of the Mobile App.
            </p>
            <p>The app is an extremely important part of the member experience. Users can submit claims, view usage, look up their coverage, and more. 
            </p>
            <p>After taking a critical look at the old app, I discovered possibilities for improvements.

            <h1>Branding</h1>
            <p>Starting with the name, I wanted the experience from start to finish to be upbeat and fun. The word 'noggn' is a silly synonym for head or brain.</p>
            <p>I used a simple san-serif font for the main typography for easy reading and simplicity. 
            </p>
            <p>For the icon, I designed a combination of a cloud and a brain to represent the digital brainstorming part of noggn's identity. Our logo signifies our achievement of creating group brainstorming on the cloud.

            <h1>Colours</h1>
            <p>Noggn's brand colours are so important to the identity. We want to be modern, yet friendly. Productive, yet quirky. </p>
            <p>We achieved this by carefully selecting bright colours that are reminiscent of technology; the bright colours of LED and multicolored wires. 
            </p>
            <p>Primary and Secondary colours can be seen in noggn's logo and throughout the platform. The text colour is a staple for all text used throughout noggn's branding and UI.
            </p>
            <p>Accent colours are used in branding, social media, and on variations of the UI.

            <h1>Social Media</h1>
            <p>This is a sample instagram stragegy for noggn's social media page. This strategy is so fun because it combines all of noggn's brand elements to create a solid identity.</p>
            <p>Noggn's target market is mainly High School and University students. The overall design of this marketing appeals to that age group.
            </p>
            <p>The quirkiness of the brand comes through with the use of memes and jokes, which appeals to younger users.
            </p>
            <p>The use of bright colours and consistent messaging allows for a welcoming feel.
            </p>
            <p>This strategy could be easily translated to other social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, however Instagram is the most useful for the target audience.

            <h1>Key Learnings</h1>
            <p>I learned a lot from this project. Not only did it take a lot of planning, organizing, and time-management, but it also took a lot of thinking, brainstorming, and trying to understand problems.</p>
            <p>For me, design is all about solving problems for people. It's about finding the things in everyday life that could be improved, and making them into amazing experiences that people will love.
            </p>
            <p>I know my job is done when users feel less stressed or even excited about tasks that once caused them discomfort.
