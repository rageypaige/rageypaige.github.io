                <p>I started full-time as a UX Design Specialist at Simply Benefits in May 2021 after completing a one-year internship. I was the sole designer on the team and in charge of the design of all products from start to finish. The skills I've learned in this role are invaluable; I've become confident in my ability to lead projects, make important product decisions, and deliver polished UI designs.

            <h1>Mobile App Designs</h1>
            <p>One of the larger projects I worked on at Simply Benefits was a complete overhaul of the Mobile App. I was the lead designer and in charge of research, ideation, and UX/UI.
            </p>
            <p>The app is an extremely important part of the member experience. Users can submit claims, view usage, look up their coverage, and more. 
            </p>
            <p>It had been a year or two since the app had any updates or improvements. 
            </p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>I started by defining several goals for the project.  </p>
            <p>Since the redesign was motivated mainly by improving the experience for users, I did some research on how those improvements could be made. 
            </p>
            <p>My research centered around finding out which features were most used by members and where users were spending the most time in the app. 
            </p>

        <div class="section-text-role">

            <p><b>Goal 4:</b> Improve and modernize the outdated UI.</p>

            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>Starting with the Dashboard/Homepage, I wanted users to be immediately presented with information that they would otherwise go looking for.</p>
            <p>Users can see their Latest Claims and Recent Usage, as well as quickly submit a claim by tapping the plus icon. 
            </p>
            <p>I also designed usage bars for the Claims and Spending Account Pages to show users how much they've spent and how much they have left.
            </p>
            <p>Pictured here are some of the UI Components I explored. Not all components made it to the final design, but it's important to try out different options!

            <h3>Feedback/Success</h3>
            <p>After the designs were launched we saw a large increase in app downloads. Members who had never used the app before were encouraged to download it, and existing app users were excited to update.  </p>
            <p>Our customer success team also received a lot of great feedback about the new designs. 
            </p>
            <p>I loved this project. Leading a redesign of an app so early in my career was intimidating but rewarding. I couldn't be happier with the results.

            <h1>Web Design</h1>
            <h3>Simply Benefits Website</h3>
            <p>User Experience is a hugely important part of Web Design. During my time at Simply Benefits, I worked with the Brand and Marketing Manager to redesign the public site.</p>
            <p>We worked together to highlight our brand mission with descriptive visuals and a simple layout.
            </p>
            <p>This is a sample of the Homepage that we designed. In total, we designed a total of 6 pages.
            </p>
            <p>Once the redesign was finished, I was in charge of the front-end development using React.js. 
            </p>
            <p>The redesign of the website decreased the bounce rate by 8% and increased session length by 12%.

            <h3>Blog Redesign</h3>
            <p>As a small side project, I was in charge of redesigning and improving the User Experience for our Blog.</p>
            <p>The previous iteration of the blog had various design issues. Most notably, though, was that it was not clear which blog was the most recent, and there was no way to search or filter content.
            </p>
            <p>This is the Homepage of the blog I designed. I added filter tags so users can find related content and a search bar. I also cleaned up the UI and highlighted the most recent blog post.
            </p>
            <p>After the design was finished, I also did the front-end development based on my designs. See it in action <a href="https://simplybenefits.ca/blog" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h1>Key Learnings</h1>
            <p>I learned a lot from this project. Not only did it take a lot of planning, organizing, and time-management, but it also took a lot of thinking, brainstorming, and trying to understand problems.</p>
            <p>For me, design is all about solving problems for people. It's about finding the things in everyday life that could be improved, and making them into amazing experiences that people will love.
            </p>
            <p>I know my job is done when users feel less stressed or even excited about tasks that once caused them discomfort.
